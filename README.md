**Bionic Image Denoising Using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**
This project focuses on denoising bionic images that are affected by Gaussian noise using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique. The approach applies a threshold to the wavelet coefficients obtained from the DWT to effectively reduce noise and improve image quality.

**Project Overview**
Objective: To reduce Gaussian noise in bionic images using the DWT technique and evaluate the performance using PSNR.
Techniques Used: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Gaussian Noise Reduction.
Evaluation Metric: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).
